        <hr/>
<p> This is an experimental repo that includes some of my work I have created over the years, which may be broken/outdated. <p>

    <p> ⚠️ Use at your own risk. ⚠️ </p>
            
<p> I stumbled upon these recently and thought I'd share my beginner skills in Objective-C back in the day using THEOS. <p>
    <p> (hopefully I find the remainder so that it wouldn't have been a complete waste!) <p>

    <p> Feedback is definitely welcome as I can try and find some spare time to update/fix these if necessary. <p>
